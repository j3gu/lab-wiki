## Why and how to use git branches and pull request

git branck and pull requests are useful for collaboration with others; but in my view they are even more useful for collaborating with yourself in research setting.

Suppose you want to try something completely different in research --- eg some alternative implementation of a computational task that may or may not improve
over existing approach, or an idea you don't know if it will work. That is when you should create a different git `branch` and try things there. If it works
you can send in a pull request to merge the branches so it become officially adopted. Another good thing about branch is that you can compare all at once 
differences in your branch from multiple commits so you know what exactly you have changed.

Please search online and learn about using branches and pull request. I suggest you can hold it off until during your research project you run into the scenario I described above. 
That will be a very good motivating case for you to start learning it
