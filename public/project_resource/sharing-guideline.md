# Guideline for internal resource sharing

## Add external data-set on server

It is required that for every data-set added, you should contribute a description of data to the [data inventory](https://github.com/xinhe-lab/lab-wiki/tree/master/public/project_resource/data), using [this template](https://github.com/xinhe-lab/lab-wiki/blob/master/public/project_resource/data/TEMPLATE.md). [Here](https://github.com/gaow/lab-wiki/blob/master/public/project_resource/data/GIANT_Height_GWAS.md) is an example contribution. [A data catelog](data) is automatically generated and published to this wiki.
