## The Genome Cancer Atlas (TCGA)

The legacy archive of the [GDC](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/legacy-archive/search/f) holds the genotype data of cancer patients from TCGA. I have downloaded the genotypes for approximately 7000 individuals from TCGA.

### Location

Genotypes: `/project2/xinhe/TCGA_genotypes/`
PLINK files: `TCGA_ALL.ped`, `snp6_all.map`
