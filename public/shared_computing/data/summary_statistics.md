### Source

This is a large collection of GWAS summary statistics from different sources. The directory contains a README describing 
how to use the directory and its contents. The file gwas_info.csv contains information about each directory/data set. 
As stated in the README, directories that do not end with `_mod` should only contain files that have been downloaded, not 
processed files. The `standard_formats` subdirectory contains data files that have been processed into particular formats.
Currently it contains files in "cause" format.
