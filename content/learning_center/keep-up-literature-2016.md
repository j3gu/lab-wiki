# Keep up with literature

Notes from [this post](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/11/how-keep-scientific-literature).

## Reading techniques

* Use an app. I have been using Read RXMD. Others have mentioned PubCrawler, Google Scholar (updates feature), alerts from journals, Twitter, Pubchase, TOC of favorite journal, talk to others, readcube. 
* Every morning, read abstracts. Save some relevant ones for later to read deeper. 
* Every Friday use a regular time block to read in details of the most relevant ones. Blog about it or Twit it within 140 characters.
* Download all papers and read them in chunks.
* Summer is best time for reading.
* Keep organized and able to backtrack is most challenging.
* Need to draw a line between specificity and sensitivity.
* Write grants and papers.
* Play with different tools and establish a reading routine.

## Read broader papers

* Papers that cited my papers
* Papers that cites an interesting paper or papers that the interesting paper cites
* Google search 

## Prioritize
* By Journal
* Crucial papers: from colleagues, conferences, meetings.
* Important papers will be cited so often that it is impossible to miss.
* Do not try to read all at once.

## An update from Oct 2019
- I organize literature with `mendeley` which seems a very popular choice as of today.
- I use `blogtrottr` to subscribe RSS feeds from journals that sends me email of abstracts. I keep track of biorxiv papers this way.
